1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,360
In the past 18 months, more than 170,000

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,200
tech workers in the United States have

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,600
lost their jobs. Used car startup Kavak

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,599
is the latest global tech name to cut

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,160
jobs. In the first 5 months of 2025

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,200
alone, more than 74,000 layoffs were

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,440
recorded in tech companies, representing

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,160
a 35% increase compared to the same

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,640
period the previous year. Meta has never

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,760
axed jobs on this scale before. 11,000

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,160
positions were about 13% of its

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
workforce. In fields like programming,

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,000
the losses are even more alarming.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,239
Between 2022 and 2024, 27% of jobs in

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,079
this area disappeared, according to

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,760
official data. Jeffrey Hinton, the

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,719
so-called godfather of AI and a pioneer

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,520
in the field, warns some industries may

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,600
be hit harder than others. At the same

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,760
time, average tech salaries have fallen

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,559
by more than 12% nationwide. All of this

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,480
has led tech workers to question whether

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,879
the industry is still worth it. So,

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,079
where are all the tech workers going?

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,079
Mass layoffs in tech have not only

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,920
reduced staff numbers, but also

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,159
triggered significant labor migration.

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,240
Thousands of highly skilled workers have

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
been forced to seek new opportunities

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,320
outside the traditional tech sector.

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,080
Some individuals have managed to quickly

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
rejoin smaller companies or take on

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
similar roles, though often with less

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,240
favorable compensation. Others have

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,479
chosen to switch industries, start their

36
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,320
own ventures, or pursue further

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,320
education or professional development

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,240
programs. Even though the overall

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,080
unemployment rate in the United States

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,720
has remained around 4.2% during the

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,439
first half of 2025, the impact on tech

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,280
employment has been significant. Layoffs

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
are only above average in three sectors,

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,320
tech, finance, and trucking. While the

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,159
specific unemployment rate in the tech

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,960
sector was 3.4% 4% in May. This figure

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,040
does not reflect the drop in entry-level

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,360
hiring. It also fails to capture the

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,439
increase in precarious work conditions

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,119
such as freelancing or temporary

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,200
contracts. Among those who lost their

52
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
jobs, about half managed to reenter the

53
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,840
labor market within 6 months. However,

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
the types of jobs they found often

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,000
differed from their previous roles. Only

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,319
32% were able to return to tech

57
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,399
companies, usually smaller or less

58
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,400
established ones. The rest transitioned

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
into sectors such as finance, consulting

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
or manufacturing. As major companies

61
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,959
like Meta, Google, Salesforce, and more

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,360
cut thousands of jobs, other companies,

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
some smaller, some in different sectors,

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,440
were eager to bring in new talent.

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,360
Abbott, for example, has hired more than

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
200 tech specific employees in the past

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,440
6 months. And a company spokesperson

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,680
says they plan to hire hundreds more in

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
the coming years. According to various

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
studies, around 10% of these workers

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,160
move into the financial industry where

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,760
there is sustained demand for

73
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,680
professionals with experience in

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
systems, data, and security. Another 8%

75
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
join consulting firms while

76
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
approximately 6% find opportunities in

77
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,959
the healthcare sector, an area

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,599
undergoing rapid digital transformation.

79
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,680
Others are employed by logistics or

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,280
manufacturing companies that are

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,599
adopting smart technologies to optimize

82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,080
operations. In this context, the use of

83
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,800
buyouts or voluntary exit programs has

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,360
become common in large tech companies, a

85
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
strategy that allows for discrete

86
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,879
workforce reductions without resorting

87
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,360
to formal layoffs. Under this model,

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,040
employees are offered financial

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,360
compensation to voluntarily leave their

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,519
positions, helping companies avoid

91
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,200
negative headlines and minimize

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,519
reputational damage. Although framed as

93
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,680
voluntary, these packages are often

94
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,920
strategically targeted at specific roles

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,239
or departments. Companies like Google,

96
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,319
Meta, and Salesforce have adopted this

97
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
practice over the past 2 years, offering

98
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,480
severance packages that include extra

99
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
weeks of pay, extended benefits, and job

100
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,360
placement assistance. Google is offering

101
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
buyouts to employees across several of

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,440
its divisions, including the unit that

103
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,760
houses its search, ad, and commerce

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
businesses. The decline in opportunities

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,159
at major tech firms has also fueled a

106
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,400
rise in self-employment. Platforms such

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,720
as Upwork, Fiverr, and TopTel have

108
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480
become common channels for offering

109
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,239
professional services in software

110
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,560
development, data analysis, or system

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
maintenance. This model offers some

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,640
flexibility, but does not guarantee

113
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,640
financial stability or access to

114
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,560
traditional benefits. For many,

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,959
freelance work serves as a temporary

116
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,359
solution while they develop a new career

117
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,759
strategy or acquire more in- demand

118
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,160
skills. At the same time, there has been

119
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,240
growing interest in entrepreneurship.

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
Some workers, particularly those with

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
more experience and access to funding

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,320
networks, have used severance pay or

123
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,240
savings to launch startups. These

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,479
ventures often focus on emerging areas

125
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,720
such as educational technology, digital

126
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,639
health, or decentralized financial

127
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,800
services. Another path that has gained

128
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,639
relevance in recent months is the

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,560
transition of tech workers into the

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,800
public sector, particularly in areas

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,639
related to cyber security. The

132
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,240
Department of Defense, the Cyber

133
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
Security and Infrastructure Security,

134
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
and other government agencies have

135
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,320
intensified their hiring efforts to

136
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,240
strengthen systems against growing

137
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,479
digital threats. This shift represents

138
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,479
an opportunity for those seeking greater

139
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,479
job stability, and a sense of public

140
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,560
mission. While government salaries are

141
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,080
generally lower than those in the

142
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,400
private sector, many professionals value

143
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
the improved work life balance,

144
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,160
long-term benefits, and the chance to

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,320
contribute to national security using

146
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,080
their technical expertise. The

147
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,240
adaptation process to this new landscape

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,720
has also involved a strong emphasis on

149
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,120
continued education. Many professionals

150
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
are turning to certifications and

151
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,199
intensive programs in areas like

152
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,120
artificial intelligence due to its

153
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,440
growing presence across a wide range of

154
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,919
industries. Cars that drive themselves,

155
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,479
facial recognition, detecting cancer

156
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,479
potentially better than a doctor. These

157
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,000
are just some of the technologies that

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
artificial intelligence is fueling.

159
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
Specialized courses on platforms such as

160
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,720
Google Cloud, TensorFlow, or Python have

161
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,880
grown in popularity along with graduate

162
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,960
programs at universities focused on

163
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,199
technology and business. This trend

164
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,120
reflects a collective effort to remain

165
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,280
relevant in an increasingly competitive

166
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,440
and specialized market where general

167
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
knowledge or traditional work experience

168
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,840
is no longer enough. However, the

169
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,680
process of re-entering the job market

170
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
has not been uniform. There are

171
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,759
significant disparities based on gender,

172
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,160
age, and prior experience. Among those

173
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,240
laid off from tech companies, women have

174
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,880
faced greater challenges. Only 31%

175
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
secured a new job within 3 months

176
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,680
compared to 38% of men. Mid-career

177
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,759
professionals have also encountered more

178
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
difficulties due to perceptions of

179
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,319
outdated skills or bias in recruitment

180
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,720
processes. At the same time, recent

181
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,039
graduates face a restrictive job market

182
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,759
with entry- level openings down 50%

183
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,479
since 2023. This summer, college

184
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,639
graduates in America are looking for

185
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,960
hire at a time when their unemployment

186
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,319
rate is at 6%. That's nearly 2% higher

187
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,319
than the overall national average.

188
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,240
Companies justify this reduction with

189
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
budget constraints and a growing trend

190
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,960
toward automating low complexity tasks.

191
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
The result of this phenomenon is an

192
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,599
increasingly segmented tech job market.

193
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,680
On one hand, there is high demand for

194
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,160
highly qualified profiles with expertise

195
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
in artificial intelligence, systems

196
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
architecture, advanced automation, and

197
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,639
data analytics. On the other hand,

198
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,479
access to entry-level roles and

199
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,560
generalist positions is narrowing,

200
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,720
creating a divide between those already

201
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,479
established in the industry and those

202
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,479
trying to enter for the first time. But

203
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,240
this divide is also reflected in

204
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,919
salaries. While some senior

205
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,840
professionals continue to earn over

206
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,319
$200,000 a year in markets like San

207
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,479
Francisco or New York, average wages

208
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,800
have declined nationwide, particularly

209
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,880
affecting those in transition or at the

210
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,560
start of their careers. The top tech

211
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,120
companies are facing hiring freezes and

212
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,039
layoffs due to cost cutting measures.

213
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,960
This new scenario presents challenges

214
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
not only for workers, but also for

215
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,039
educational institutions and policy

216
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,800
makers. There is a growing need to

217
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
promote reskilling programs, incentives

218
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,039
for hiring new talent, and social

219
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,720
protection schemes for independent

220
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
workers. Additionally, it is essential

221
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,360
to ensure transparency in layoff and

222
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
hiring processes, as well as to

223
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,680
facilitate mechanisms for labor mobility

224
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,759
across sectors that make full use of

225
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,370
this highly qualified workforce.
