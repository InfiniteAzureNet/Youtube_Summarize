1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,600
All right, I'm going to be completely

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,760
honest with you. The tech job market

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,160
right now isn't cooked. The standard is

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,240
just raised significantly. The required

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,679
talent and skills to get you an

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,120
entry-level software engineering role

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,200
paying $90,000 a year is completely

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,920
different now compared to 10 years ago.

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,680
I've been watching developers with five

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,000
plus years of experience get rejected

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,160
from junior positions. I've seen boot

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,640
camp graduates with perfect portfolios

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,439
go months without a single interview.

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,279
The reason is because everyone is using

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,000
the same outdated methods that just

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,480
don't work today. I'm not going to get

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,320
into it in this video. If you want to

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,320
know more about what works today, you

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,120
can watch my other videos.

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,800
I want to talk about a different

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,040
opportunity, a different path software

22
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,120
engineers can take to make same income

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,239
as a normal dev job. Wilts also

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,840
experienced the location and time

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,600
freedom that everyone seems to be

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,960
working towards since co. What nobody's

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,640
talking about is while everyone's

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,359
fighting over the same shrinking pool of

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,600
traditional tech jobs, there's this

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,080
massive opportunity sitting right in

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,760
front of us that most developers

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,400
completely ignore. In the next 10

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,119
minutes or so, I'll break down why

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,159
freelance devs are making a killing and

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,240
how you can do the same to reclaim

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,200
control of time and income in a way

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,880
that's different to the traditional

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,000
path. I know my whole channel has been

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,400
about landing tech jobs, but what you

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,960
probably didn't know was I was also a

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,200
freelance software engineer, too. As

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,040
nice as it is to have a stable income

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,880
from a traditional job and normal

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,520
9-to-five hours, freelancing also has

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,479
its pros, too. You work as much as you

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,960
want, work whatever hours you want, and

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,439
technically have no income cap. And with

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,280
how brutally competitive the tech job

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,000
market is now, with companies laying off

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
experienced developers while

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,880
simultaneously posting job listings they

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,680
never intend to fill. with AI tools

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
making employers think they need fewer

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,159
developers with the ones that are hiring

55
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,920
wanting entry-level developers to have

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,479
five plus years experience even though

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,319
that doesn't really make sense.

58
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,280
Statistically, it's impossible for every

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,520
aspiring dev to get a role working at a

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,080
big firm unless you got me as a mentor.

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,000
I have had students come to me with

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,720
solid portfolios, great technical

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,560
skills, who've been job hunting for

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,120
eight plus months with nothing to show

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,360
for it. Not because they're not good

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,920
enough, but because they're playing a

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,160
rigged game. Meanwhile, I've been

68
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
quietly freelancing on the side for

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
years. During my time freelancing, I was

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,400
making $15,000 in pure take-home from

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
freelance projects, working maybe 20

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,200
hours total. What surprised me was that

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
small businesses are desperate for

74
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
developers. While big tech is laying

75
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,000
people off, every local business needs a

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,959
website, an app, some kind of digital

77
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
solution. They have money, they have

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
problems, and they don't care if you

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,280
went to Stanford or learn to code last

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,080
year. They just want someone who can

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,480
solve their problems professionally. But

82
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,319
here's where most people get this

83
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,800
completely wrong. Everyone thinks

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,440
freelancing is about competing on price

85
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,400
on Upwork. charging $15 an hour to build

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,560
someone's WordPress site. That's not

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,280
freelancing. That's digital slavery.

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,360
Real freelancing is about becoming the

89
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
technical co-founder these businesses

90
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,319
can't afford to hire full-time. It's

91
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,239
about packaging your skills into

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,640
solutions, not selling your time by the

93
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,879
hour. While everyone else is trying to

94
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,360
get hired, you're going to get hired by

95
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,519
multiple companies at once. Instead of

96
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,920
hoping one company values you at $80,000

97
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,760
a year, you're going to have five

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
companies each paying you $2,000 a month

99
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,040
for ongoing work. Same money, but you're

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,959
in control. And that changes everything.

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,959
The modern freelancing reality. Now, I

102
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,400
know because the last time I did

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,239
freelance work was last year.

104
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,000
Re to give you a little update about my

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,720
life. Recently, I am working recently,

106
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,280
but not a full-time job. I'm uh helping

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,080
out a friend. He started his own company

108
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,400
and he got um he got some contract with

109
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,959
some government that's helping out a

110
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,759
manufacturing execution system and I'm

111
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,040
making the chatbot and it's uh it's it's

112
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,759
a challenge and I'm I'm I'm up for any

113
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,440
challenge really. Um

114
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,759
so I've made a lot of progress on that.

115
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,639
And another update, you know, uh I

116
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,479
haven't shaved since I've uh been laid

117
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,120
off, uh you know, for like the 6 to 8

118
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
weeks that I've been laid off. People

119
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,479
are going to come at me in the comments

120
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,840
saying things like, "He did this x years

121
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,880
ago. What he's saying won't work now, or

122
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
the freelance market is so much more

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,280
saturated now. I have mentees making

124
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,440
successful careers as freelancers right

125
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,680
now." Ultimately led to me finally

126
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,840
landing uh my first freelance job. Uh I

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,400
Phil made a connection uh to somebody

128
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,919
who was a ex CMO I think of IKEA which

129
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,720
was the uh website that I made for him

130
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
and ever since then we've kind of kept

131
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,400
open communications and anything that

132
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
needs for the website or maybe something

133
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,039
else he's looking at creating or even

134
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,440
some random like business solution types

135
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
things that another company might ask

136
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,520
him for. I've been able to dip my toe in

137
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,320
that provide some quick solutions. With

138
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,720
that in mind, let me break down how

139
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,440
freelancing actually works in 2025

140
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,000
because everything has changed. First,

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,080
the AI tools like Claude and Kitup

142
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Copilot have cut development time in

143
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,560
half. This may sound scary, like you

144
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,720
don't stand a chance, but this is your

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,440
advantage. You can now deliver projects

146
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,759
twice as fast, which means you can serve

147
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,160
more clients or charge premium rates for

148
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,479
speed. I watched a senior developer

149
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,039
charge $30 an hour because he was

150
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,160
competing on time. Meanwhile, I charge

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,560
$2,000 for an MVP that takes me 10 hours

152
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,680
to build with AI assistance. Same work,

153
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,960
completely different framing.

154
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,639
Pillar one, solution over

155
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,639
specialization. Here's the beautiful

156
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,199
thing about freelancing. There's not so

157
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,960
much pressure on being a specialist

158
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,440
compared to the traditional job market.

159
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,520
If you can create the desired solution,

160
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,759
no one cares what language you used or

161
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,080
how your code looks. Understanding the

162
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,919
scope of work required for the solution

163
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,000
is way more important than technical

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,160
perfection. This means really

165
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,560
understanding your target market, what

166
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,960
problems they face, what solutions they

167
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,360
need, and how much those solutions are

168
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,160
worth to them. Pillar two, package.

169
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,720
Don't price. Stop charging hourly.

170
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,039
Instead of I charge $50 an hour for

171
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,280
development, I'll build you a complete

172
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,400
e-commerce solution for $5,000. The key

173
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,639
things to remember is that you're not

174
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,720
selling features. You're selling

175
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,199
benefits. Don't say, "I'll build you a

176
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,880
website with five pages and a contact

177
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,120
form." Say, "I'll build you a system

178
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,680
that captures leads 24/7 and converts

179
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,759
visitors into paying customers." Same

180
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,520
work, but now you're selling the

181
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,880
outcome, not the process. Pillar three,

182
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,919
underpromise overd deliver. The only way

183
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,840
to build a long-term freelance business

184
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
is by delivering a damn good product or

185
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,360
service. If your product is good, it'll

186
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,759
do the selling for you. You can build a

187
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,680
book of business through referrals.

188
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,080
Build social proof and eventually have

189
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,919
people come to you instead of the other

190
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,800
way around. One amazing project beats 10

191
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,120
mediocre ones every single time.

192
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,840
Step one, identify your target market,

193
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,080
especially in the beginning. It's easier

194
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
to serve one market since there's less

195
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,000
variability in your scope of work for

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,240
each project. If the first market

197
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,720
doesn't work, move to the next. Don't

198
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,960
try to be everything to everyone right

199
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,960
away. Step two, build your portfolio.

200
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,039
Just like the traditional job market,

201
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,280
you need projects to show you can do the

202
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,840
job. Build examples that directly solve

203
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,479
problems your target market faces. I've

204
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,400
mentioned this multiple times throughout

205
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,800
my other videos, but it's really that

206
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,879
simple in order to get noticed. People

207
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,120
want to visualize what you can do. Step

208
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,000
three, master selling and presenting.

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
Here's what most developers don't

210
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,240
realize. Delivering a good product isn't

211
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,479
enough on its own to build a freelancing

212
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,039
business. You need to know how to sell

213
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,680
and present your solution. Well, this is

214
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,919
a skill you have to develop, just like

215
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,880
coding. Step four, rinse and repeat.

216
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,959
Keep refining your approach until you

217
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,360
get your first couple of customers. Then

218
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,440
use those wins to build momentum for the

219
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,000
next ones.

220
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,240
It sounds simple because it is. Think

221
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
about it this way. A small business will

222
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,640
pay $300 to $800 monthly for digital

223
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
solutions, but a midsize company will

224
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,600
pay $3,000 to $8,000 monthly for the

225
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
same type of work because the impact is

226
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,920
proportionally bigger. Businesses need

227
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,959
ongoing projects, too. System upgrades,

228
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,120
new features, seasonal campaigns,

229
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,360
integration work. A small client is

230
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
worth $1 to $3,000 annually beyond

231
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,839
retainers. A bigger client would be

232
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,399
around $10 to $50,000 annually in

233
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,560
project work. I have a friend who

234
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,040
started with one pizza shop, built them

235
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,800
an ordering system that led to a

236
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,560
regional pizza chain contract worth

237
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,920
$150,000 annually. Same core skills, but

238
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,320
he learned to think bigger. That's the

239
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,160
power of starting small but scaling

240
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,560
smart.

241
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,120
Common mistakes that kill your success.

242
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,920
Mistake one, competing on price. Never

243
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,560
be the cheapest option. Be the most

244
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,880
professional, most reliable option.

245
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,360
Cheap clients are nightmare clients.

246
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,480
Mistake two, over complicating the tech.

247
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
They don't care if you use React or

248
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,720
vanilla JavaScript. They care if it

249
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,519
works, loads fast, and makes them money.

250
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,760
Mistake three, forgetting the business

251
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,920
side. You're spending 50% of your time

252
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,040
coding, 50% managing clients, marketing,

253
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,600
and admin. Plan for this reality or

254
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
you'll burn out fast. I feel like it's

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,160
important to reiterate that the tech job

256
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,880
market isn't actually saturated. It's

257
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,959
just broken. Companies are posting

258
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,040
impossible job requirements because they

259
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,200
don't understand what they actually

260
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,079
need. They want 3 plus years experience

261
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,160
for entry-level roles because HR

262
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,720
departments are using outdated filters

263
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,839
that made sense in 2015. But freelancing

264
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,600
gives you a different playing field

265
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,079
entirely. You're not competing with

266
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,040
1,000 other developers for one position.

267
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,279
You're the only developer talking to

268
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,279
this specific restaurant owner about

269
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,680
their specific problem. And here's the

270
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,959
beautiful part. You can do both. Keep

271
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,880
applying for jobs while building your

272
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,440
freelance income. Worst case scenario,

273
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,600
you have multiple income streams. Best

274
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
case scenario, your freelance income

275
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,240
becomes so good, you never need a

276
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
traditional job. Think about it this

277
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,720
way. Instead of hoping one company will

278
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,120
pay you $100,000 annually, you could

279
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,000
have 20 clients each paying you $500

280
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,120
monthly. That's $120,000 annually and

281
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,200
you're the boss. Why this works even

282
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,360
better now? The remote work revolution

283
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
made small businesses realize they don't

284
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,920
need local developers. But it also made

285
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,000
them realize most developers don't

286
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
understand their business. If there's

287
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,680
anything you should take away from this

288
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
video, it's that you're not just a

289
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,480
developer. You're a problem solver.

290
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
You're someone who can take a business's

291
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,680
vision and turn it into reality. Every

292
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,000
business owner I've worked with has the

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,720
same story. They had an idea. They

294
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,880
needed technical help and they were

295
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,640
willing to pay well for someone who

296
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,120
actually understood both the technical

297
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,320
and business sides. The tech job market

298
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,720
might be broken, but the demand for real

299
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,120
solutions has never been higher. While

300
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
everyone else is fighting for permission

301
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,200
to prove their worth, you can start

302
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,160
proving your worth this week. The choice

303
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,560
is yours. Keep playing the game where

304
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,720
you have no control or start playing the

305
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,040
game where you make the rules. The

306
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,360
opportunity is there. The framework

307
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,920
works. Stop waiting for someone else to

308
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,760
give you a chance and start creating

309
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,839
your own chances. If you found this

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,399
The market is waiting for you. Coding

313
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,279
saves lives.
